## About

Tumult is an [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)-compatible plugin that adds macOS-specific functions and scripts to your ZSH environment.

Some of these are mine, and have an Apache 2.0 license, some of them were written by other people and just colllected by me - the authors and licenses are embedded in those scripts.

Tumult will check to see if you're running on macOS and not add aliases or inject its bin into your `$PATH` if you aren't. This was done to enable you to use the same plugin list in all your environments without polluting your `$PATH` with incompatible functions and scripts on your non-Apple machines.

You may also find the [git-extra-commands](https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands) collection useful, or my [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit)

## License

The Tumult collection is Apache 2.0 licensed. Some scripts in the `bin` directory have different licenses - if so, they have those other license statements embedded inline in their source.

## Installation

Tumult is packaged as a ZSH plugin to make it easier to use if you're already using a ZSH framework. If you don't already use a framework, I recommend [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom), because it is wicked fast and also supports using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)'s internal plugins.

### Other shells / not using a framework

If you're using other shells like `bash` or `fish`, or aren't using a framework with `zsh`, you can install it by cloning this repository and adding its `bin` directory to your `$PATH`.

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Add `antigen bundle unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh` to your `.zshrc` with your other bundle commands.

Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start `zsh`. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH with `antigen bundle unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
2. `git clone git@github.com:unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh.git tumult`
3. Add tumult to your plugin list - edit `~/.zshrc` and change `plugins=(...)` to `plugins=(... tumult)`

### [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)

Add `zgenom load unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgenom load` calls in. Zgenom will handle automatically cloning the plugin for you the next time you do a `zgenom save`.
